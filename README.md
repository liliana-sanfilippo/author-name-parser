# Bibtex Author parser

![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen)

Name parsing grammar for ANTLRts, indended to be used to parse names of authors in bibtex sources. 

Planning can be seen in the [Wiki](https://github.com/liliana-sanfilippo/author-name-parser/wiki). The wiki also contains a [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/liliana-sanfilippo/author-name-parser/wiki/Troubleshooting) that will be expanded as errors and problems occur. 

Plan: to develop it into a full webpack parser.
